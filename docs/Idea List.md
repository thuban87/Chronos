- [ ] Could maybe make a way to combine events that are scheduled for the same time into one google calendar event
- [ ] Need to add a way for users to answer a custom time frame and events. For instance if it's a two-day event, they need to be able to set that before the sync. Custom duration is the phrase I'm looking for.
- [ ] Insert events idea. 
	- [ ] Insert today's agenda: inserts the events from your chosen calendar's current day into a new note (or a chosen note) that lists each event as a link that points back to the calendar event. Each list item is added as a task in obsidian. This could cause endless loops though, right?
	- [ ] Insert X: Popup modal allowing user to select a calendar, then shows events from that calendar with checkboxes. User clicks which events (or selects all or none) they want to link in the note, then hit apply, and it adds all events as links in a list
- [ ] Make a "Rules" manager that allows you to exclude folders/files from the sync
- [ ] Need a date picker for the task event creation "Add Date & Time" modal. The one you get when you originally set the time. Everything is a picker except for the date, which is annoying
- [ ] Need a way to add things like time, don't sync, special notifications, etc when there's already a date set (all day event). The emojis aren't intuitive enough for me and I need somewhere to copy them from since I don't know how to make them out of thin air. Ideally using tasks popup menu could fix this if possible.
- [ ] Can we tie Chronos and Switchboard together somehow so that events that are manually scheduled in Switchboard get events made in calendar?
