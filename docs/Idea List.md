- [ ] Need a way to add things like time, don't sync, special notifications, etc when there's already a date set (all day event). The emojis aren't intuitive enough for me and I need somewhere to copy them from since I don't know how to make them out of thin air. Ideally using tasks popup menu could fix this if possible.
- [ ] Can we tie Chronos and Switchboard together somehow so that events that are manually scheduled in Switchboard get events made in calendar?
- [ ] Pending deletions modal needs some love. I just got hit with 18 when I added a new folder I copied over with tasks in it. Anyways, it doesn't really mention what's getting deleted. It SORT OF implies the calendar events but I think I just know that inherently because I worked it. We need to clarify that. Also, lets add some info on the files like what file or at least folder they're coming from.
- [ ] Need to go over README with a fine tooth comb. Already have a star on github! Need to make sure the docs are good and modern
