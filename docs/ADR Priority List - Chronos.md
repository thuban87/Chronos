## Pre-Release Checklist (Future Reference)

For whenever release is considered - no timeline, just reference material:

### OAuth Architecture (Updated Session 4)

**Current Approach:** User-provided credentials

Each user creates their own Google Cloud project and provides their own Client ID and Client Secret. This approach:
- Complies with Google ToS (credentials not publicly shared)
- Eliminates shared API quota concerns
- Matches pattern used by other Obsidian Google plugins (obsidian-google-calendar)
- No OAuth verification needed from plugin developer

**User Setup Requirements:**
- Create Google Cloud project (free)
- Enable Google Calendar API
- Configure OAuth consent screen (can stay in "Testing" mode for personal use)
- Create Desktop app OAuth credentials
- Add themselves as test user (if in Testing mode)

**Trade-off:** More setup friction for users, but better security and no shared liability.

---

## Phase 18: Recurring Task Succession - PLANNED

**Goal:** Fix duplicate event bug when completing recurring tasks with Tasks plugin.

| Order | Feature | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 105 | Store recurrenceRule in SyncedTaskInfo | Pending | Currently only stores isRecurring boolean |
| 106 | Third reconciliation pass | Pending | Detect successor tasks in computeMultiCalendarSyncDiff() |
| 107 | Sync record migration | Pending | Transfer eventId from old task to successor |
| 108 | Pending successor check queue | Pending | Defer check to handle race condition with Tasks plugin |
| 109 | Series disconnection modal | Pending | User chooses: delete series or keep |
| 110 | Recurrence change modal | Pending | Handle significant pattern changes (every day → every week) |

**The Problem:**
1. Task with 🔁 syncs to Google as recurring event (RRULE)
2. User completes task → Tasks plugin creates new instance below
3. Chronos sees new task → creates ANOTHER recurring event
4. Result: Duplicate recurring series in Google Calendar

**The Solution:**
- Add third reconciliation pass to detect "successor" tasks
- Match by: same title + same time + same file + has recurrence + future date
- Transfer sync record to successor instead of creating new event
- Deferred check (2 sync cycles) to handle race condition
- Modals for edge cases (no successor found, pattern changed)

**Implementation Guide:** `docs/Recurring Task Succession - Implementation Guide.md`

**Phase 18 Deliverable:** Completing a recurring task transfers tracking to the successor without creating duplicates.

## Maybe Someday (Post-BRAT)

Features that are valuable but complex or low priority. May implement based on user demand.

| Feature | Value | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Two-way sync (Calendar → Obsidian) | High | High | Major feature, needs conflict resolution, refactoring |
| EditorSuggest `@cal` trigger | Medium | Medium | Type-to-insert; hotkey modal works well enough |
| ~~Recurring event support~~ | ~~Medium~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Completed in Phase 14 |
| Calendar event colors | Low | Low | Color by tag or priority |
| Glob pattern exclusions | Low | Medium | Support `*.template.md` or `Archive/**` patterns |
| Include-only mode | Low | Medium | Only sync from specific folders (inverse of exclusions) |

---

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

| Item | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| ~~Debug console.logs~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✓ Fixed - Removed |
| ~~No duplicate prevention~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Task ID tracking |
| ~~scanVault reads every file~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Uses metadataCache to skip files without tasks |
| ~~Embedded OAuth credentials~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - User-provided credentials |
| ~~Task ID uses line number (wrong)~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Title-based ID + two-pass reconciliation |
| Accidental completion edge case | Low | Unchecking creates duplicate (user can delete manually) |
| Severed task edit-back edge case | Medium | When severed task is edited, then edited back to original time, reconciliation doesn't detect the change and task remains severed. Workaround: edit to a different time than original. |
| **Recurring task completion duplicates** | **High** | **Completing a recurring task creates duplicate calendar events. Tasks plugin creates new instance, Chronos syncs it as new recurring series. Fix planned in Phase 18.** |

---

## Known Limitations

Document these for users:

| Limitation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Rename + Move = Recreate | Renaming a task AND moving it to a different line simultaneously will delete the old event and create a new one. This is rare and essentially a "new task" anyway. |
| Mode change requires reload | Changing the Event Routing Behavior mode requires reloading Obsidian to take effect. |
| True duplicates not supported | Two tasks with identical title, date, time, and file cannot both sync. First occurrence wins, second is skipped with a warning. |
| Legacy sync data | Tasks synced before Session 10 may lack lineNumber/time fields, causing a one-time delete+create on first edit. Subsequent edits work correctly. |

| Phase 3 (Event Creation) | 2-3 hours | ~1.5 hours | API worked well once scope was fixed |
| Phase 4 (Sync Infrastructure) | 2-3 hours | ~2 hours | External deletion detection added |
| Phase 5 (Task Lifecycle) | 1-2 hours | ~1 hour | Completion options added |
