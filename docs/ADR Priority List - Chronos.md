## Pre-Release Checklist (Future Reference)

For whenever release is considered - no timeline, just reference material:

### OAuth Architecture (Updated Session 4)

**Current Approach:** User-provided credentials

Each user creates their own Google Cloud project and provides their own Client ID and Client Secret. This approach:
- Complies with Google ToS (credentials not publicly shared)
- Eliminates shared API quota concerns
- Matches pattern used by other Obsidian Google plugins (obsidian-google-calendar)
- No OAuth verification needed from plugin developer

**User Setup Requirements:**
- Create Google Cloud project (free)
- Enable Google Calendar API
- Configure OAuth consent screen (can stay in "Testing" mode for personal use)
- Create Desktop app OAuth credentials
- Add themselves as test user (if in Testing mode)

**Trade-off:** More setup friction for users, but better security and no shared liability.

### Plugin Submission Checklist

|------|--------|
| User-provided OAuth credentials | ✓ Complete |
| README.md with setup instructions | ✓ Complete |
| LICENSE file (MIT) | ✓ Complete |

| 42 | Time zone setting | ✓ Complete | Dropdown with System Local + 35 common IANA timezones |

**Phase 7 Deliverable:** Users can see today's events at a glance and configure timezone explicitly. ✓

**Additional features:**

- Tag changes create new event in new calendar (old event becomes dormant)
- Completed/orphaned tasks handled with their stored calendar ID

**Phase 8 Deliverable:** Tasks tagged #work go to Work calendar, #personal to Personal, etc. ✓

## Phase 9: Power User Features - COMPLETE ✓

**Goal:** Transparency and customization for power users.

| Order | Feature | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 46 | Sync log/history | ✓ Complete | Batched by sync run with collapsible cards, summary counts |
| 47 | Per-task reminder override | ✓ Complete | `🔔 30,10` syntax + modal UI with toggle and input fields |

## Maybe Someday (Post-BRAT)

Features that are valuable but complex or low priority. May implement based on user demand.

| Feature | Value | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Two-way sync (Calendar → Obsidian) | High | High | Major feature, needs conflict resolution, refactoring |
| EditorSuggest `@cal` trigger | Medium | Medium | Type-to-insert; hotkey modal works well enough |
| Recurring event support | Medium | High | Parse `🔁` from Tasks plugin |
| Batch operations | Low | Medium | Bulk sync/unsync commands |
| Calendar event colors | Low | Low | Color by tag or priority |

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

| Item | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| ~~Debug console.logs~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✓ Fixed - Removed |
| ~~No duplicate prevention~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Task ID tracking |
| ~~scanVault reads every file~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Uses metadataCache to skip files without tasks |
| ~~Embedded OAuth credentials~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - User-provided credentials |
| Accidental completion edge case | Low | Unchecking creates duplicate (user can delete manually) |
