## Pre-Release Checklist (Future Reference)

For whenever release is considered - no timeline, just reference material:

### OAuth Architecture (Updated Session 4)

**Current Approach:** User-provided credentials

Each user creates their own Google Cloud project and provides their own Client ID and Client Secret. This approach:
- Complies with Google ToS (credentials not publicly shared)
- Eliminates shared API quota concerns
- Matches pattern used by other Obsidian Google plugins (obsidian-google-calendar)
- No OAuth verification needed from plugin developer

**User Setup Requirements:**
- Create Google Cloud project (free)
- Enable Google Calendar API
- Configure OAuth consent screen (can stay in "Testing" mode for personal use)
- Create Desktop app OAuth credentials
- Add themselves as test user (if in Testing mode)

**Trade-off:** More setup friction for users, but better security and no shared liability.

### Plugin Submission Checklist

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| User-provided OAuth credentials | ✓ Complete |
| README.md with setup instructions | ✓ Complete |
| LICENSE file (MIT) | ✓ Complete |
| manifest.json version updated | Pending |

| Performance optimization (metadataCache) | ✓ Complete |
| Tested on Windows | ✓ Complete |

|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 41 | Daily agenda sidebar | ✓ Complete | Shows all Google Calendar events (not just Chronos-synced), day navigation, event colors |
| 42 | Time zone setting | ✓ Complete | Dropdown with System Local + 35 common IANA timezones |

**Phase 7 Deliverable:** Users can see today's events at a glance and configure timezone explicitly. ✓

---

## Phase 8: Multi-Calendar & Event Routing - COMPLETE ✓

**Goal:** Route tasks to different calendars by tag, with user control over what happens when routing changes.

| Order | Feature | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 43 | Tag-to-calendar mapping UI | ✓ Complete | Settings UI for adding/removing tag→calendar mappings |
| 44 | Multi-calendar sync logic | ✓ Complete | Each task routes to calendar based on its tags |
| 45 | Default calendar fallback | ✓ Complete | Tasks with no/unmapped tags use default calendar |
| 46 | Case-insensitive tag matching | ✓ Complete | #Work matches #work mappings |
| 47 | Event Routing Behavior modes | ✓ Complete | Preserve (move), Keep Both (duplicate), Fresh Start (delete+create) |
| 48 | Calendar change warning modal | ✓ Complete | Shows event count, mode description, processing time |
| 49 | Reroute failure modal | ✓ Complete | Prompts when source calendar inaccessible |
| 50 | Task ID reconciliation fix | ✓ Complete | Title-based ID + two-pass line/title reconciliation |

**Additional features:**
- Multiple mapped tags warning (uses default calendar with notice)
- Tags stripped from event titles
- Google Calendar moveEvent() API for Preserve mode
- Processing time warning in modal
- Reload warning for mode changes
- Updates preserve user-edited event data (description, location, attendees)
- Duplicate task detection with warning

**Phase 8 Deliverable:** Tasks tagged #work go to Work calendar, with user control over what happens when tags/calendars change. ✓

---

## Phase 9: Power User Features - COMPLETE ✓

**Goal:** Transparency and customization for power users.

| Order | Feature | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 51 | Sync log/history | ✓ Complete | Batched by sync run with collapsible cards, summary counts |
| 52 | Per-task reminder override | ✓ Complete | `🔔 30,10` syntax + modal UI with toggle and input fields |

**Additional polish (Session 7):**
- Sync history groups operations by batch with collapsible cards
- Custom reminders UI in date/time modal (toggle + 2 input fields)

**Phase 9 Deliverable:** Users can debug sync issues and customize reminders per-task. ✓

---

## Phase 10: Batch API Calls - COMPLETE ✓

**Goal:** Dramatically improve sync performance for users with many events.

| Order | Feature | Status | Notes |
|-------|---------|--------|-------|
| 53 | Batch request builder | ✓ Complete | Multipart MIME body construction in batchApi.ts |
| 54 | Batch response parser | ✓ Complete | Parses multipart response, maps to operation IDs |
| 55 | Refactor sync to collect-then-batch | ✓ Complete | ChangeSet pattern, buildChangeSet() method |
| 56 | Partial failure handling | ✓ Complete | Individual results processed, failures queued for retry |
| 57 | Smart retry (500/503) | ✓ Complete | 5-second wait, single retry on server errors |

**Performance Improvement:**
- Before: 100 events = 100 sequential requests = 30-50 seconds
- After: 100 events = 2 batch requests (50 each) = 2-5 seconds

**Implementation Details:**
- New file: `src/batchApi.ts` with BatchCalendarApi class
- Batch size: 50 operations (safe margin below Google's 100 limit)
- Pre-fetch pattern: Batch GET for events needing existing data (updates, completes)
- Existence verification: Batched GET for unchanged events

**Phase 10 Deliverable:** Large calendar migrations complete in seconds instead of minutes. ✓

## Maybe Someday (Post-BRAT)

Features that are valuable but complex or low priority. May implement based on user demand.

| Feature | Value | Complexity | Notes |
|---------|-------|------------|-------|
| Two-way sync (Calendar → Obsidian) | High | High | Major feature, needs conflict resolution, refactoring |
| EditorSuggest `@cal` trigger | Medium | Medium | Type-to-insert; hotkey modal works well enough |
| Recurring event support | Medium | High | Parse `🔁` from Tasks plugin |
| Calendar event colors | Low | Low | Color by tag or priority |

---

## Technical Debt / Known Issues

| Item | Priority | Status |
|------|----------|--------|
| ~~Debug console.logs~~ | ~~Low~~ | ✓ Fixed - Removed |
| ~~No duplicate prevention~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Task ID tracking |
| ~~scanVault reads every file~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Uses metadataCache to skip files without tasks |
| ~~Embedded OAuth credentials~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - User-provided credentials |
| ~~Task ID uses line number (wrong)~~ | ~~High~~ | ✓ Fixed - Title-based ID + two-pass reconciliation |
| Accidental completion edge case | Low | Unchecking creates duplicate (user can delete manually) |

---

## Known Limitations

Document these for users:

| Limitation | Explanation |
|------------|-------------|
| Rename + Move = Recreate | Renaming a task AND moving it to a different line simultaneously will delete the old event and create a new one. This is rare and essentially a "new task" anyway. |
| Mode change requires reload | Changing the Event Routing Behavior mode requires reloading Obsidian to take effect. |
| True duplicates not supported | Two tasks with identical title, date, time, and file cannot both sync. First occurrence wins, second is skipped with a warning. |
| Legacy sync data | Tasks synced before Session 10 may lack lineNumber/time fields, causing a one-time delete+create on first edit. Subsequent edits work correctly. |
